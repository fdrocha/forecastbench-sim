# run_continuations.js

Branching variant of `run_sim.js`. It runs one **trunk** simulation for `S`
turns, snapshots the entire engine state (a byte copy of WASM linear memory),
and then runs many **continuations**: each restores that snapshot, reseeds the
engine RNG with a different seed, and runs `H` more turns. Everything is
streamed to **stdout as JSONL**; nothing is written to disk. Timing and progress
go to stderr.

Intended use: estimate P(event within H turns | state at turn S) by piping the
stream into a reader that applies the same event detectors used on
`run_sim.js`'s files.

```
pnpm tsx cli/run_continuations.js --city haight -S 1440 -H 480 --branch-seeds 1-100 \
    | python3 reader.py
```

## Arguments

| Flag | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `--city`, `-c` | `haight` | Builtin city, same choices as `run_sim.js`. |
| `--seed` | `42` | **Trunk** seed. Applied before `loadCity()` exactly as in `run_sim.js`, so the trunk is identical to `run_sim.js --seed N` for the same city. |
| `--branch-at`, `-S` | required | Turn at which to snapshot and branch. 1 turn = 16 ticks = 1 `cityTime` increment. |
| `--horizon`, `-H` | required | Turns each continuation runs past the branch point. |
| `--branch-seeds` | required | Inclusive range `lo-hi` (or a single `n`) of continuation seeds, run in ascending order. Shard across processes by giving each a disjoint range. |
| `--no-trunk-output` | off | Skip streaming the trunk run (turns 0..S). The trunk is still simulated. |
| `--no-disasters` | off | Disable random disasters, as in `run_sim.js`. |
| `--verbose-log` | off | Include low-signal events (`simulateRobots`, `simulateChurch`, `updateMap`, `updateHistory`, `updateDate`), as in `run_sim.js`. |
| `--progress` | off | One stderr line per finished continuation. |

There is no `--log-every-tick`; exactly one stats row is emitted per turn.

## Output stream

One JSON object per line. Every line has a `kind` field, and every line except
`header` has a `seed` field: `null` for the trunk, the branch seed for a
continuation. Lines appear in this order:

```
header
begin  (trunk)          ┐ omitted with --no-trunk-output
stats/event ... end     ┘
begin  (seed lo)
stats/event ... end
begin  (seed lo+1)
...
```

Within a run, `stats` and `event` lines are interleaved in simulation order.
Runs never interleave with each other. A reader therefore needs only one
run's worth of state at a time: reset on `begin`, finalize on `end`.

### `header` (once)

```json
{"kind":"header","city":"haight","trunkSeed":42,"branchAt":1440,"horizon":480,
 "branchTick":23040,"endTick":30720,"seedLo":1,"seedHi":100,
 "disasters":true,"trunkOutput":true}
```

### `begin` / `end` (per run)

```json
{"kind":"begin","seed":7,"run":"continuation","fromTick":23040,"toTick":30720}
{"kind":"end","seed":7,"run":"continuation","rows":480,"cityTime":6759}
```

`run` is `"trunk"` or `"continuation"`. `rows` is the number of `stats` lines
emitted in that run. `end.cityTime` is the engine clock at the end of the run.

### `stats` (one per turn)

The same fields as a row in `run_sim.js`'s `log-seed<N>.jsonl`, plus
`kind` and `seed`. See `snapshot()` in `run_sim.js` for the field list;
`census` is the nested tile census object.

```json
{"kind":"stats","seed":7,"tick":23056,"cityName":"haight","cityTime":6280,
 "cityYear":2030,"cityMonth":10,"cityClass":3,"cityScore":...,"census":{...}}
```

### `event` (one per engine callback)

The same fields as a row in `run_sim.js`'s `events-seed<N>.jsonl`, plus
`kind` and `seed`. Base fields are `tick`, `event`, `cityTime`, `cityYear`,
`cityMonth`; the rest depend on `event` exactly as in `run_sim.js`
(e.g. `sendMessage` carries `messageNum`, `messageText`, `x`, `y`,
`pictureFlag`, `important`).

```json
{"kind":"event","seed":7,"tick":23138,"event":"sendMessage","cityTime":6286,
 "cityYear":2030,"cityMonth":11,"messageNum":32,"x":7,"y":90,
 "pictureFlag":false,"important":false,"messageText":"Explosion detected!"}
```

## Tick and time numbering

`tick` counts `simTick()` calls from the start of the trunk and **continues**
into each continuation: a continuation's ticks run from `branchTick + 1` to
`endTick`, and its `cityTime`/`cityYear`/`cityMonth` continue from where the
trunk left off. All continuations start from the identical state, so their
first stats rows share the same `cityTime`.

## Guarantees

- Restoring the snapshot is exact: a continuation's output depends only on
  (city, trunk seed, S, H, branch seed), not on which seeds ran before it in
  the same process.
- Stats and event rows are field-for-field identical to `run_sim.js`'s, so a
  parser written for those files works here after reading `kind` and `seed`.
- stdout is written synchronously, so a slow reader applies backpressure
  rather than causing the producer to buffer in memory. Drain or discard
  stderr if you capture it.

## Reader sketch

`cli/count_stream.py` is a minimal consumer that parses every line and tallies
lines and bytes per `kind`; use it as a template. The core loop is:

```python
for raw in sys.stdin.buffer:
    rec = json.loads(raw)
    if rec["kind"] == "begin":   state = new_state(rec["seed"])
    elif rec["kind"] == "stats": on_stats(state, rec)
    elif rec["kind"] == "event": on_event(state, rec)
    elif rec["kind"] == "end":   results.append(finish(state))
```

Filter on `rec["seed"] is None` to skip or separately handle the trunk.

## Performance (haight, S=1440, H=480, one core, `-O3` engine)

About 110 ms per continuation (100 seeds in 11 s; 1000 seeds in under 2
minutes), roughly 60% engine and 40% snapshot/JSON serialization. Piping into
a Python reader costs nothing measurable; Python parses this stream several
times faster than one producer emits it. To scale, run one producer per core
with disjoint `--branch-seeds` ranges.
