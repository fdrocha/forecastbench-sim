"""Run a Civilization game and generate world reports

This script runs an all-AI competitive game where ALL players are controlled
by Freeciv's built-in AI, then automatically generates world reports from the
recorded gameplay.

Setup:
- Sets aifill=5 to create 5 total players in the game
- Connects as player 'myagent2' (1 of the 5)
- Toggles myagent2 to Freeciv AI control via /aitoggle
- The other 4 players are AI-controlled by default
- Result: 5 Freeciv AI players, ALL using the same strategy

NoOpAgent's role:
- Simply returns None to end turn immediately
- Freeciv AI actually plays for this player
- This allows CivRealm to maintain connection and record observations

Result: A competitive 5-player all-AI game with full recording coverage.
All players use the same Freeciv AI algorithm, ensuring fair comparison.

After the game completes, world reports are automatically generated.
